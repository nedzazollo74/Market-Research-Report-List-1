<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Current Collectors For Rail Transit Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Top-Running</li><li>Bottom-Running</li><li>Side-Running</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Current collectors for rail transit come in three main types: top-running, bottom-running, and side-running. Top-running collectors are mounted above the train, utilizing overhead wires to gather power, ideal for high-speed systems. Bottom-running collectors attach to the train’s underside, typically using a sliding contact with a rail, making them suitable for light rail applications. Side-running collectors operate from the train's side, drawing power from adjacent conductor rails, often used in densely populated urban areas for space efficiency.</p></p>
